            In the beginning Tom created the repo. Now the project was fileless
            and empty, darkness was over the surface of VSCode, and the cursor
            of Tom was hovering over console. <br />
            Tom said, "<code>ng new my-portfolio</code>" and there was an awful
            lot of files. Tom saw that the file explorer was massive, and he
            separated the project from the chaos. Tom called the project
            “index.html,” and the chaos he called "<code
              >npm uninstall angular</code
            >". And there was simplicity, and there was peace—the first site.

            As much as I find myself enjoying being The Almighty in my own
            digital kingdom, for the sake of my own sanity I'll leave the more
            traditional allegoric prose behind.
            <br />
            This is my website. It isn't much, but it's mine. Whether it will
            eventually resemble the promised land I'm envisaging, or collapse
            into some kind of elysian fields for my heroic but ultimately doomed
            attempts to write code, only time will tell. But optimism is free,
            and I'm a right sucker for a bargain.
